#### What are BRCA1 and BRCA2?

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that produce tumor **suppressor** proteins. Specific inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 most notably increase the risk of **female breast and ovarian cancers**. A harmful *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* mutation can be inherited from a person’s **mother or father** with **50% chance** to pass it on to child.

- **Breast cancer**

  About **12%** of women  will develop during life. About **72%** of women who inherit a harmful ***BRCA1*** mutation and about **69% of** women who inherit a harmful ***BRCA2*** mutation will develop breast cancer **by the age of 80.** 

- **Ovarian cancer**

  About **1.3%** of women  will develop during life.  About **44%** of women who inherit a harmful ***BRCA1*** mutation and about **17%** of women who inherit a harmful ***BRCA2*** mutation will develop ovarian cancer by the age of **80**

- **Other cancer**

  Fallopian tube cancer and peritoneal cancer;

  **Men** with BRCA2 mutations, and to a lesser extent BRCA1 mutations, are also at increased risk of **breast cancer and prostate cancer** ;

  Both men and women with harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are at increased risk of **pancreatic cancer**;

  Certain mutations in BRCA2 (also known as **FANCD1**), if they are **inherited from both parents**, can cause a rare form of **Fanconi anemia (subtype FA-D1)** ;

  certain mutations in BRCA1 (***FANCS***), if they are **inherited from both parents**, can cause another **Fanconi anemia subtype** 

#### Certain racial/ethnic populations

People of **Ashkenazi Jewish** descent have a **higher prevalence** of harmful BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations than people in the general U.S. . Also, **Norwegian, Dutch, and Icelandic** peoples have a higher prevalence.

#### Genetic test result

- **Positive** 

  A person has inherited a known harmful mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2, but cannot tell whether or when an individual will actually develop cancer. This indicates that **his or her siblings has a 50% chance** of having inherited 

- **Negative** 

  - True negative: If a close **(fisrt- or second-degree) relative** of the tested person is **known to carry** a harmful *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* mutation, the result means that **this person doesn't carry the gene** responsible for family's cancer risk
  - False negative:  The tested person has a **family history that suggests the possibility** of having a harmful mutation in *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* but complete **gene testing identifies no such mutation in the family**,

- Uncertain/Ambiguous

  Change in *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* that **has not been previously associated** with cancer (about 10% of women had this type )

#### Other gene factors

Mutations in the genes ***TP53*, *CDH1*, and *CHEK2*,** which increase the risk of **breast** cancer, and in ***RAD51C*, *RAD51D*, and *STK11***, which increase the risk of **ovarian** cancer. 

Genetic testing for these other mutations is available as part of **multigene (panel) testing**

#### Implications of harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation

- Higher possibility of developing  a second cancer in either the **same (ipsilateral)** breast or the **opposite  (contralateral)** breast. Some women chose a bilateral mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery.
- Tend to be  **"TNBC (triple-negative cancers)"** (that is, the breast cancer cells do not have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or large amounts of HER2/neu protein), which generally have **poorer prognosis** than other breast cancers.
- A class of drugs called **PARP inhibitors [e.g.  olaparib (Lynparza™) and rucaparib (Rubraca®)]**, which block the repair of DNA damage, have been found to **arrest the growth of cancer cells** that have *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* mutations. **Olaparib** is also approved for **HER2-negative** metastatic breast cancers
