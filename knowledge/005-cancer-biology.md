### Lecture1~ Cancer Terms and Definitions

Cancer means **"uncontrolled growth"** => uncontrolled devision of abnormal cells in a part of the body

Also referred to as a "**tumor**" => a swelling of a part of the body, generally without inflammation, caused by an abnormal growth of tissue, whether benign or malignant

Also referred to as a "**neoplasm**" => a new and abnormal growth of tissue in some part of the body

So, cancer is caused by an **accumulation of detrimental variation** in the genome instead of single mutation

#### Where does the word from?

##### about cancer

- From Greek => "a crab" (because some tumors with swollen veins are similar to crabs )
- From Latin => "a crab" => "maglignant tumor"
- Old English => "spreading sore"

##### about Oncology

"onco" means bulk, mass or tumor => a study branch of tumor and cancer science

##### about Metastasis

From Greek => "migration; a changing; revolution"

Now refers to the spreading of cancer from primary site to distant organs

#### Where does cancer start?

> Cancers are classified into **four main types** according to the tissues where they originate

- **Carcinoma**: Arise in epithelial tissue (internal and external lining of the body)

  - **Adenocarcinomas** develop in an organ or gland; 
    [**Most common** cancer including prostate, breast, liver cancer]

    > First look at the cervical histology

    > Then look at the Carcinoma (Prostate Cancer)

  - Squamous cell carcinorma develop in the squamous epithelium of organs, including the skin, bladder, esophagus, and lung

- **Sarcoma:** [Account for < 10% ]Arise from connective tissue that is found in bones, tendons, cartilage, muscle, and fat  

  > This is Ewing's Scarcoma

- **Leukemia:**  cancer of the blood that originate in bone marrow

- **Lymphoma:** Cancers of the lymph system (starting from lymph node)

### six most common cancers worldwide

> The global cancer burden is estimated to have risen to **18.1 million** new cases and **9.6 million deaths** in 2018

- **Lung** 

  - Function: Lungs deliver air(oxygen) to the blood
  - **Most common** in men and women, extremely lethal
  - Many **subtypes**, but **85%** are non-small-cell cancers (**NSCLC**), including adenocarcinoma (40%), squamous cell carcinoma (25%) and large-cell carcinoma (10%)
  - **Risk factors**: **Smoking** (87% in men and 70% in women) => 25 times higher risk compared to non-smokers

- **Breast** 

  - milk-producing glands surrounded by fat and connective tissue. The gland connect to ducts which carry milk out to the nipple![image.png](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/9376801-cf719e15fa6cbeff.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

  - Most common cancer in US women; Second leading cause of cancer death

  - **Classified** by location and histologic ( tissue or cellular) subtype. **70% -80% are infiltrating ductal cancers**, followed by lobular and nipple cancers

  - **Risk factors**: 
    Age: 1/8 cancers in women **under 45**; 2/3 are in women **over age 55**;

    Positive family history: Approximately **double** if having **one first-degree relative** (mother, sister, or daughter);

    Genes: **BRCA1** increase risk by **55-65%**, BRCA2 by 45%;
    Dense breast tissue: may make **mammograms less acurate**
    **Lifestyle**: Obesity, inactivity, alcohol use, not having children, oral contraceptive use, post-menopausal hormone therapy

  - Prevention: **No known proven** strategies, **except for prophylactic mastectomy** in high-risk women 

  - **Screening:** Self-exams, Yearly exams by health practitioner, Mammograms, **MRI, ultrasound (potentially)**

- **Colon**

  - Five-foot-long tube at the end of the digestive system that store waste

    Rectum is the last 6 inches of the colon

  - Third most common cancer 

  - Most primary colon cancers are **adenocarcinomas**

  - **Detected early => could be cured**

  - **Risk factors**: 
    Age (9/10 diagnosed people are over 50-year-old);
    Diet: High in red meats, low in vegetables;
    Lifestyle: Obesity, smoking, alcohol;
    Inflammatory bowel disease;
    Positive family history: Approximately double with one affected first-degree relative;
    Genes: DNA repair=> APC, KRAS, TP53

  - Colon cancer **screening**: 
    Colonscopy every 5-10 years from age 50 

- **Prostate** 

  - A gland about the size of a walnut below the bladder 

    Only found in men; 
    Thought to protect the urinary tract from infections

  - **Screening:** 
    Yearly digital rectal exam starting at age 50;
    Yearly prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood tests at age 55-69;
    African-americans or with + family history screen at age 40

    *H.pylori*: Chronic infection with this bacteria
    Diet: smoked foods, salted fish/meat, pickled vegetables
