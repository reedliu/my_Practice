### Cancer Terms and Definitions

Cancer means **"uncontrolled growth"** => uncontrolled devision of abnormal cells in a part of the body

Also referred to as a "**tumor**" => a swelling of a part of the body, generally without inflammation, caused by an abnormal growth of tissue, whether benign or malignant

Also referred to as a "**neoplasm**" => a new and abnormal growth of tissue in some part of the body

So, cancer is caused by an **accumulation of detrimental variation** in the genome instead of single mutation

#### Where does the word from?

##### about cancer

- From Greek => "a crab" (because some tumors with swollen veins are similar to crabs )
- From Latin => "a crab" => "maglignant tumor"
- Old English => "spreading sore"

##### about Oncology

"onco" means bulk, mass or tumor => a study branch of tumor and cancer science

##### about Metastasis

From Greek => "migration; a changing; revolution"

Now refers to the spreading of cancer from primary site to distant organs

#### Where does cancer start?

> Cancers are classified into **four main types** according to the tissues where they originate

- **Carcinoma**: Arise in epithelial tissue (internal and external lining of the body)

  - **Adenocarcinomas** develop in an organ or gland; 
    [**Most common** cancer including prostate, breast, liver cancer]

    > First look at the cervical histology

    > Then look at the Carcinoma (Prostate Cancer)

  - Squamous cell carcinorma develop in the squamous epithelium of organs, including the skin, bladder, esophagus, and lung

- **Sarcoma:** [Account for < 10% ]Arise from connective tissue that is found in bones, tendons, cartilage, muscle, and fat  

  > This is Ewing's Scarcoma
